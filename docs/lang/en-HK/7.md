Scripts located in a folder called “WebApp Modules”. Each of them perform an independent task or act like a microservice that power the whole system. Users can install the WebApp modules they need using Package Manager or Upload Tools, similar to Play Store or Apple Store on current smartphones, package installed can also be uninstalled via the Package Manager with an easy of pressing a button.

ArOZ Online is built on top of multiple layers of microservices which make up the “core” of the whole system. The main components of the ArOZ Online Cloud System Architecture is as follows.

- AOauth (including auth.php / login.php etc) + user Isolation (/functions/user/userIsolation.php)
- SystemAOB (AOB stands for ArOZ Online Base), some functions include: AOR/SystemAOB/functions/
- Cluster Controller (./cluster)
- File System Bridge (./file_system)
- General Purpose Input Output Controller (./GPIO) 
- System Information (./info)
- WebApp List Menu (./list_menu)
- Package Manager (non-official, ./package_manager)
- Personalization Settings (./personalization)

- Windows SMB File Share Configs (./samba_config)
- System Management Tools (./system_management)
- System Statistics (./system_statistic)
- Timezone Settings (./system_time and ./timezone)
