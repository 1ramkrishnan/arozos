# Quick Start
This quick start guide already assumed you have basic knowlege of using a computer, and this tutorial is written based on Windows Operating System.

You will need the following hardwares to build yourself a ArOZ Cloud System.
- Raspberry Pi (Recommended 3B+ or 4B)
- WiFi USB dongle or ethernet cable in which the network gateway is in the same LAN as yours.
- 16GB or above micro SD card
- Power supply for the raspberry pi
- Client devices (Smartphone, tablet PC or laptops, with WiFi function and / or able to access the same local area network with the pi)

## Image Writing

First, you will need Win32 Disk Imager and ArOZ Online System Image for Raspberry Pi.
You can find them in the links below.
[Win32 Disk Imager ](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/)
[ArOZ Online System Images](https://hkwtc.org/aroz_online/dist/)

After finish download and installing the image and software, you would see a new desktop icon appeared. Double click to start the Win32 Disk Imager.

## Hardware Preparation

You can either choose WiFi AP or Ethernet with LAN access for your initiation network interface.

First, insert the newly flashed SD card into your pi's SD card slot.

### Setup with WiFi AP
If you are using WiFi AP setup, open the WiFi discover interface on your devices and search for the following SSID and login with the following password.

SSID: 
<code> ArOZ Portable </code>
Passwordï¼š
<code>arozportablesystem</code>

After connected and turned off mobile data, open your default browser and enter <code>http://192.168.4.1/AOB/</code> into the URL bar. Following the on screen instructions to continue the account creation process.

### Setup with Ethernet + Local Area Network

If you are not using WiFi AP method for the setup process, you can use the ethernet + LAN method to setup ArOZ Online System. But first you need to know your Raspberry Pi's IP address. This can be achieved with the following methods.
- Visit your DHCP server in which in most of the case, it would be your gateway router, and found the Raspberry Pi IP address under DHCP > Client options.
- Use a IP scanner like Angry IP Scanner
- Use imuslab [Web Scanner](http://lanips.imuslab.com/) for ArOZ Online System.
- Use third party ArOZ Online System Scanner like [ alanyeung.co Finder](http://alanyeung.co/AOBRedirect/scan.html)

The following tutorial will use the imuslab Web Scanner instead.

Visit the Web Scanner with *Firefox or Chrome*. Make sure the starting part of the URL is  <code> http:// </code>  instead of  <code> https:// </code>. You should be able to see similar results as the following image indicating a ArOZ Online System devices has been discovered.

If the Web Scanner didn't return anything similar to the image below, try rebooting the raspberry pi, wait until the green light stop blinking and try again.
