# External Storage Devices
ArOZ Online Community Edition support two external storage devices by default.
You can also modify the system to support more external storages up to the system maximum allowance.
They are usually auto-mounted in the following locations:

<code>/media/storage1</code> and <code>/media/storage2</code>

The system only support NTFS formatted USB storage devices like *USB Drives*, *Portable Hard Disk* etc. You can also use SATA to USB adapter to convert a 2.5 inch or 3.5 inch SATA hard drive to your host device. But you should note that due to powering issue of the Raspberry Pi, you might encounter system stabilitiy issues due to underpower of the external storage devices. Unless you use a USB powered hub for the purposes, we usually recommend users to only use USB drives or Portable Solid State Drives for external storage purposes.

## Tips for Brand New USB Drives
If you just bought a new USB Drive for your cloud system, we recommend a full NTFS format before uses. This is due to many of the new USB Drives comes with a exFAT or FAT32 formats which ArOZ Online System  Auto Mounting Settings do not support. 

You could use the Windows build in tool to format your USB drive to NTFS format as follow.

It is recommend not to select the "Quick Format" button if your USB drive contains encrypted partitions, your USB drive is 2nd handed or you have use it to install another Opertaion Systems 9aka Bootable USB Drive). 

## Boot From Hard Disk
Some advance users might choose to boot from external hard disk instead of the internal Micro SD card. Hence, the system drive will occupied the mount point for  <code> /dev/sda* </code> . To solve the error in auto mounting, you need to edit <code> /etc/fstab </code> and change the mounting devices as follow. Please edit <code> /etc/fstab </code> file and change the following two lines.

```
/dev/sda1 /media/storage1 ntfs defaults,nofail,noatime,x-systemd.device-timeout=1 0 0
/dev/sdb1 /media/storage2 ntfs defaults,nofail,noatime,x-systemd.device-timeout=1 0 0
```

into the following

```
/dev/sdb1 /media/storage1 ntfs defaults,nofail,noatime,x-systemd.device-timeout=1 0 0
/dev/sdc1 /media/storage2 ntfs defaults,nofail,noatime,x-systemd.device-timeout=1 0 0
```

## Adding More Devices
In most case, you won't be using more than 2 external storage devices at the same time. However if you really need more than 2 mount points, you can create it by creating more folders in the media directory with the following commands. For example, this is the command for creating a 3rd mount point.

```mkdir /media/storage3```

Another example for creating the 4th mount point.

```mkdir /media/storage4```

And so on.

Be aware that the manual created mount points will not be automatically mounted during the system startup. You might need to edit <code> /etc/fstab </code> according to your needs. You can find out more with the link below.
