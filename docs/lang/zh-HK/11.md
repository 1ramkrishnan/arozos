# MyHost and File Explorer
ArOZ Online System provides two main way to manage files and drives on the host devices. They are the "MyHost" tool included in the Desktop Module and the "File Explorer" included in the ArOZ Online System Core. In this page, we will introduce you to the two file / drive manager and how to use them to manage your files on the Host Device.


## MyHost
MyHost is a disk management tool included in the Desktop Module. It shows all the local disk and *remote disk* information on the ArOZ Online System. 

*Remote Disk function is only available on the Full Version or aCloudX edition* 

### Local Disk Management
You can see all the disk mounted on your local file system through the myHost > Host Devices tab. 

If you are hosting on a Linux device like the Raspberry Pi, you would see the drives denoted by the mount points.

Or if you are deploying the ArOZ Online System on a Windows based device, you will see the drives are denoted by its drive letter.

If you are using the Full Version of aCloud or aCloudX Edition, you will see the following tab by clicking "Network Drives" tab. Through this interface, you can access network location with tokens generated beforehand.

MyHost also provide basic media discovery interface for finding files or documents through out the internal storage spaces.

### Read Only File Viewer
ArOZ Online System by default do not allow access out of the ArOZ Online Root (AOR). Hence, for all the files outside of AOR, it is either read-only nor not readable. The MyHost provide an interface for listing files in different directory but do not allow starting or browsing their contents.

## File Explorer
File Explorer is the most important service in the ArOZ Online System. It provides file system bridging function to the underlaying Linux file system, allow users to open, copy, move, and create files and folders. 

Here is an example of the File Explorer interface under VDI mode.

### UMFilename - Upload Manager File Naming Methods
Some filename uploaded to the ArOZ Online System contains wierd, unsupported characters. This might cause by many different reasons like OS upgrade, opening ArOZ Online with a computer that use different lanuages or file copy and paste from a Linux PC to a Windows PC. To solve this issue, we used a new naming method called "umfilename" and "hexfoldername" method. As their name suggest, it is very simple to understand.

<table class="ts table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>File Naming Method</th>
<th>Encode Method</th>
<th>Represent Color</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Default (UTF-8)</td>
<td>None</td>
<td>White</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>UM-Filename</td>
<td>"inith" + bin2hex({original_filename}) + "." + {original_ext}</td>
<td>Blue</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HEX-Foldername</td>
<td>bin2hex({original_foldername})</td>
<td>Green</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

However in the ArOZ Online File Explorer, all the filenames and foldername will be shown in "human readable format". Hence, color code is used to seperate between different encoded names. Here is an example with hexfoldername and umfilename.

### More Functions
File Explorer also provide more functions other than file operations. For example, zip and download, file properties viewing and **Default Opening Module** for a particular file extension. More about **Default Opening Module** will be documented in the Developer sections.
