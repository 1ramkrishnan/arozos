["List Menu"]
# List Menu
List Menu is a general purpose menu design to perform tasks like launching applications, shortcuts to different media files, access to file explorer and settings. You can also launch some build in utilities from the menu and perform basic file search on the bottom search bar.

Here are some example of the list menu functions.

## Power Options
You should be noted that the power options on the list menu are ***REAL POWER BUTTON OF THE HOST DEVICE***. That means if you shut down the server from a remote location, you will need to restart it manually.

## List Menu Icons
The icons are loaded from each of the module's img/ directory. If a filename ```small_icon.png``` is found, this image file will be used as icon. Or otherwise, ```function_icon.png``` will be used. Hence, you might see some icons are too small to read if you are installing third party modules. In most of the case, it is the problem from the module itself instead of the list menu's issue. 

## "Help / Support" button not working?
Yes, this is normal if you are using the community edition. Help or Support is only provided to users that is using pre-built systems distributed by OEM manufacturer. In this case, the "Help and Support" button will be linked back to OEM's webpage.  Hence, in community edition, as the button is not programmed, no "Help and Support" will be shown when clicked.
