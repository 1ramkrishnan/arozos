## Support PWA Mode
To support PWA Mode, you will need some extra lines of code and a file named <code> manifest.json</code> according to [Google's defination](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/).

In simple words, you will need to add this line in the head section of your WebApp

```
<link rel="manifest" href="manifest.json">
```

Here is an example <code> manifest.json</code> for ArOZ Online Audio module.

```
{
  "name": "ArOZ Audio",
  "short_name": "AudioA",
  "icons": [{
    "src": "img/pwa/128.png",
      "sizes": "128x128",
      "type": "image/png"
    },{
      "src": "img/pwa/192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    }, {
      "src": "img/pwa/256.png",
      "sizes": "256x256",
      "type": "image/png"
