## Installation
### For Raspberry Pi (For Raspberry Pi 4B+)

If you are using Raspberry Pi as your host, you can download one of the images and flash the image into your SD card. You will find a new network device named "ArozOS (ARxxx)" pop up in your "Network Neighbourhood". 
Double click the icon and you will be redirect to the system Web setup interface.

You can find the links of the image in the README file of the Github repo.

To optain the .img file, you can unzip the compressed image using 7zip. If you don't have it, you can get it here

### For other ARM SBC(e.g. Orange Pi / Banana Pi / Friendly ARM's Pis)

Download the correct architecture binary from the "release" tab and upload the binary with the "web" and "system" folder in "/src". After upload, you should have the following file structure

```
$ ls
aroz_online_linux_arm64  web  system
```

Start the binary by calling sudo ./aroz_online_linux_arm64 (or without sudo if you prefer no hardware management)

### Windows

If you are deploying on Windows, you need to add ffmpeg to %PATH% environment variable.

This system can be built and run on Windows hosts with the following build instructions

```
# Download the whole repo as zip and cd into it
cd .\arozos\src\
go build
arozos.exe
```

However, not all features are available for Windows.
