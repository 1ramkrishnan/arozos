# Web Desktop Interface
Web Desktop Interface, aka Virtual Desktop Mode (VDI Mode), is a mode that allow users to use ArOZ Online Cloud System using a OS-Like desktop interface on their web browser. VDI mode support all basics Desktop operations including create shortcuts, window drag-drop, maximize, hide and close, opening files and folders and more.

VDI mode is powered by Float-Window system. It combines multiple WebApps and system services in ArOZ Online barebone into one easy to use interface which looks like a Desktop Interface. Hence, its name “Virtual Desktop Interface”.

In VDI mode, Function Bar provide Float Window management functions and navigations to different tools and utilities on the user interface. List Menu provide a quick way to launch WebApps from a list and Device Mounting Manager shows the current mounted external storage devices like USB drives and HDD. Float Windows system in VDI mode allows multiple WebApps to be opened in one browser tab by initializing WebApps in iframes, which also provide a sandbox function for javascripts. The maximum number of Float Windows that can be opened in VDI mode is limited to 50 Windows. This value might increase in the future after the mainstream browsers support iframe multithreading.

The name of the corresponding elements on the VDI mode is shown in the diagram below.

Other than desktop based function, the Desktop Mode also support some simple file operations including remove file, move files or rename. However, it is still recommended to use the File Explorer for more complex operations as File Explorer supports asynchronize file operations compare to desktop's synchronize file operation which might freeze when handling large files on Raspberry Pi.
