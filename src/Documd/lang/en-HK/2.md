# Manual Installation
For those who are not using the Raspberry Pi SBC to deploy the ArOZ Online System, we do also support some of the other architectures. Including but not limited to
- ARM64 (E.g. Orange PI Zero Plus)
- x86_64 (With Intel or AMD CPU, running Debian 8 (deprecated), 9 or 10)
- Windows (7 / 8.1 / 10 with WAMP / XMAPP, with some function limitation)

However, manual installation is required for deploying the system on the platforms above. Here are the tutorial for the manual installation process.

## Prerequisite
You need the following apt packages for ArOZ Online deployment.
- apache2
- libapache2-mod-xsendfile
- php libapache2-mod-php php-cli php-common php-mbstring php-gd php xml php-zip
- php-mysql (Optional)
- ffmpeg (Optional, please use libav-tools if you are still using Debian Jessie)
- samba (Optional)

You can use the following commands in terminal to install all of them.

```
sudo apt-get install -y apache2
sudo apt-get install -y php libapache2-mod-php php-cli php-common php-mbstring php-gd php xml php-zip 
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-xsendfile
sudo apt-get install php-mysql
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
sudo apt-get install samba
```

If you are using Debian Buster or its forked distributions, you might want to run the following comamnds before installing all the packages listed above. You should run the following command with super user (su) permission.

apt-get install sudo unzip net-tools ntfs-3g


## Installing ArOZ Online System
First, you need to modify the PHP upload file size limit. In most case, the config file can be found at
 /etc/php/{php-version}/apache2/php.ini. Find and replace the following two lines.

```
upload_max_filesize = 2048M
post_max_size = 2048M
```
  
Add www-data into /etc/sudoers. 
Tips: If your cloud system is deploying for public access, due to security reasons, you should modify the permission setting according to your own needs. If you are deploying under a NAT router or private network for PERSONAL USES, you can just use the command below.

```
www-data ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```

  
Edit /etc/apache2/apache2.conf and add the following two lines at the bottom of the file.

```
XSendFile on
XSendFilePath /media
```
  
Create new folder at /media/storage1 and /media/storage2 for mounting external storages.

```
sudo mkdir /media/storage1 /media/storage2
```

  
cd into /var/www/html/ ï¼Œuse "wget" to download the ArOZ Online Distribution Pack. You can use the following commands to automate the process for you. Please remember to replace the ```{dist-pack}``` to the dist-pack name you are downloading.

```
cd /var/www/html/
sudo wget {dist-pack}.zip
sudo chmod 777 {dist-pack}.zip
sudo unzip -o {dist-pack}.zip
rm install.zip
sudo mkdir -p "/etc/AOB"
sudo chmod 777 -R "/etc/AOB"
sudo chmod 777 -R ./AOB
sudo chown -R www-data ./
```
