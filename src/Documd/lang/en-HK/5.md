# Advanced Documentation
Starting from this page, the documentations will focus on explaining the system design and architecture.

## Why I need to know how the system works?
As a developer, you can still create your new ArOZ Online WebApp without knowing how everything works in the system. However, knowing how the system works will definetly bring you more idea to work around some functions that is not covered by the ao-module wrapper. 

If you are not interested in knowing how the system works, feel free to skip to "Developer" documentations.
