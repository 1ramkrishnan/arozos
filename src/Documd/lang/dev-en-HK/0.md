# Developer Documentation
Welcome to the documentation for developers. 

***If you are normal users whom want to deploy and use the system, read the standard documentation instead.***

## Welcome to the ArOZ Online System
 Willing to try new stuffs is a great way to learn something new. In this developer documentation, as the author of the system, I will try to explain how to develop a brand new WebApp module for the ArOZ Online System with the skills you already known: HTML + CSS + PHP + Javascript. Trust me, it is as simple as building a website.

## In-System Programming IDE
ArOZ Online System allows developer to perform realtime development within the system itself. This is speically useful while programming on the go.
We recommend using either Notepad++ or NotepadA (ArOZ Online WebApp module) to develop your new WebApp. Of course you can also use other development tools like VSCode or Vim if you know how to exit Vim, but in most of the case the editing method boils down to these two.

1. Edit remotely, either through Samba or SSH / WinSCP
2. Direct edit on ArOZ Online Web Desktop Interface usng in system programming tools like NotepadA

Know more about NotepadA - a Notepad++ like tool for ArOZ Online System in the page "NotepadA".
